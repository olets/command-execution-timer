Check the [Issues](https://github.com/olets/command-execution-timer/issues) to see if your topic has been discussed before or if it is being worked on. Discussing in an Issue before opening a Pull Request means future contributors only have to search in one place.

The test suite uses [zsh-test-runner](https://github.com/olets/zsh-test-runner) v2.x. See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for instructions on running the test suite.
